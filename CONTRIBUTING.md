# Contributing

Active involvement from the community is essential to making the Famous Engine the most capable and performant JavaScript rendering engine. You can help by reporting bugs, fixing bugs, adding features, and providing feedback.

## Reporting bugs and other issues

Famous is a platform that is always testing the limits of where browsers can go. As a result, it's likely that you may encounter bugs or other issues while developing with it. If you think you've encountered a bug, do the following:

1. Make sure you are working with the latest version of the Famous `develop` branch.
2. Browse through the [issues][1] to check if anyone else has already reported the issue you're seeing. If someone has, feel free to add more information to that issue.
3. If no one has yet submitted the issue you are encountering, be sure to include as much information as possible, including errors, warnings, screenshots, or videos that help us reproduce it.

## Contributing code

The Famous platform is made possible by contributors like you. We're thrilled to get help from the greater community --- but before you start, **become acquainted with our workflow**. Following these guidelines below will make collaboration much smoother and increase the chances that we will accept your pull request.

### Development process

Our development process is very similar to the approach described in the article [_A Successful Git Branching Model_][2]. Here's an overview:

* Our `develop` branch is the main development branch.
* All commits intended for `develop` should be submitted via pull request.
* Only maintainers can accept pull requests from forks.
* Please squash your commits into a single commit before making a pull request.

### Getting started

1. Make sure you have a [GitHub account][4].
2. [Fork famous][5].
3. Keep your fork up to date.
4. Make sure you have a [Contributor License Agreement][6] on file.

### Contributor License Agreement

Before we can accept any contributions to Famous, we first require that all individuals or companies agree to our [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)][6].

The e-mail address used in the pull request will be used to check if a CLA has already been filed, so be sure to list all email addresses that you might use to submit your pull requests when filling it out.

### Testing

All pull requests must pass our tests before they can be merged.  Any new functionality should have corresponding tests to ensure they are working properly.

### Bug fixes

If you'd like to contribute a fix for a bug, first read up on [how to report a bug][7]. By filing the issue first, we may be able to provide you with some insight that guides you in the right direction.
